# SunnySolitaire - Klondike Solitaire Game Application

A full-stack **Klondike Solitaire** game designed and developed using **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **AWS**. This application enables users to play the classic card game of Solitaire with enhanced features such as real-time move validation, secure authentication, and optimized performance for an exceptional user experience.

## Key Features

### 1. **Real-Time Move Validation**
   - The game engine ensures that moves made by the player are validated in real time, ensuring only legal moves are allowed.
   - Validations include checking for proper card stacking, tableau rules, foundation placements, and stockpile usage.
   
### 2. **Game State Management**
   - The state of the game (including the cards, piles, and moves) is managed and stored in a **MongoDB database**.
   - MongoDB ensures persistent storage of game sessions, enabling users to resume their game from where they left off.

### 3. **User Authentication**
   - **GitHub OAuth** is used for secure user authentication, allowing users to sign in through their GitHub accounts.
   - This allows players to save their game progress, track scores, and manage preferences securely.

### 4. **Redis Caching for Optimized API Performance**
   - **Redis** is utilized for caching frequently accessed data (such as game states and player statistics), reducing the load on the database and improving response times.
   - This results in faster game load times and better user experience during gameplay.

### 5. **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**
   - The frontend is built using **React** and **TypeScript**, with a strong focus on **client-side rendering (CSR)** for fast page loads and minimal server interaction.
   - React ensures efficient UI updates, providing a smooth experience for players as they make moves, drag and drop cards, and interact with the game.

### 6. **Responsive Design**
   - The web interface is designed to be fully **responsive** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **React**, ensuring compatibility across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
   - This enables seamless gameplay regardless of screen size.

### 7. **Optimized API Performance**
   - **Node.js** and **Express** are used for building RESTful APIs, with optimizations for handling game logic and user interactions.
   - API endpoints are designed to handle requests efficiently, ensuring quick interactions between the client and server.
   - **Redis** caching is integrated into the backend to store commonly requested data, reducing latency and improving overall performance.

### 8. **Game Logic and Flow**
   - The game logic includes complex rules for moving cards between tableau piles, foundation stacks, and the stockpile.
   - Card movements are tracked to prevent invalid moves and ensure the integrity of the game state.
   - As cards are moved or stacked, the game automatically updates the visual representation for the player.

### 9. **Card Shuffle and Deal**
   - The card deck is shuffled and dealt using a **custom shuffle algorithm** that ensures randomness and fairness.
   - Cards are drawn from the stockpile and can be moved between tableau piles, following the traditional Solitaire rules.

### 10. **Scoring and Tracking**
   - Player scores are tracked and stored, with a focus on calculating performance based on the time taken and the number of moves made.
   - A scoring system is integrated to encourage players to complete the game efficiently.

### 11. **AWS Deployment**
   - The backend is deployed on **AWS**, ensuring high availability, scalability, and reliable performance.
   - The frontend is also hosted in the cloud, providing seamless access to the game from anywhere.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** to ensure a dynamic, responsive, and maintainable user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by **Node.js** and **Express**, serving the RESTful APIs for game logic, user authentication, and game state management.
- **Database**: **MongoDB** is used to store user data and game states persistently, allowing users to resume their games anytime.
- **Authentication**: **GitHub OAuth** is used for secure user login, offering a simple and secure authentication method.
- **Caching**: **Redis** is used to optimize API performance by caching game states and user statistics.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Hosted on **AWS** for scalability and reliability, ensuring that the application can handle multiple users simultaneously.

## Performance Optimizations

- **Redis caching** is leveraged to store frequently accessed game data, significantly reducing database queries and improving response times.
- **Client-side rendering** minimizes the need for full-page reloads, leading to faster interactions and a smoother user experience.
- **Asynchronous processing** in the backend ensures non-blocking operations, allowing efficient handling of user requests.

## Conclusion

This Klondike Solitaire game application showcases a robust architecture, incorporating modern web technologies and optimization techniques for a seamless, engaging gaming experience. With features like real-time move validation, secure authentication, and optimized performance, this game is designed to deliver a top-tier user experience across all devices.
